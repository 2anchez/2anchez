Hi there! I'm Christian - aka 2anzhez

    👋 I am currently working learning code through openclassrooms courses!
    🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help enhance my skills as a web developer.
    👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack web developer!
    2021 Goals: Complete my course and become a developer.
    Fun fact: I enjoy football and basketball; on my free time I will head to the field / court to catch the football or shoot some hoops!
