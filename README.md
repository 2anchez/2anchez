# Hi there! I'm Christian - aka [2anchez][website]



👋  I am currently learning code through openclassrooms courses!
🌱  I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS.
💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help enhance my skills as a web developer.
👀  I’m interested in becoming a full stack web developer!
🥅  2021 Goals: Contribute more, as well as, completing my course and become a developer.
⚡  Fun fact: I enjoy football and basketball; on my free time I will head to the field / court to catch the football or shoot some hoops!
